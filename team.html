								<h3>Jason Lin, Ph.D.</h3>
								<p>I am a staff scientist at <a href="https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/gan/kenkyujo/" target="_blank">Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute</a>, and one of those who think themselves are funny but in reality not at all. After getting a Ph.D. in chemistry working on proteomics applications, I came to Japan in 2015 as a postdoctoral researcher, working on drug discovery and computational genomics, and in 2020 I became a permanent staff scientist and continued to purse independent and institutionally focused projects.</p><br/>

								<h4>M. Kusakabe (Ph.D 2021)</h4>
								<h5>Thesis area: exploratory statistical analysis for epidemiology</h5>
								<p>Masato and Miho<sup>1</sup> are working together in performing exploratory statistical analysis in various large-scale epidemiological datasets such as <a href="https://www.jmicc.com/" target="_blank">J-MICC</a>, <a href="https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/gan/kenkyujo/project/mecs-en.html" target="_blank">Chiba Genome Cohort</a> and national cancer registries (via <a href="https://kapweb.chiba-cancer-registry.org/" target="_blank">KapWeb</a>).</p><br/>
								<h4>S. Sakuma (D2)</h4>
								<h5>Thesis area: machine learning</h5>
								<h4>I. Hosoya (M1)</h4>
								<h5>Thesis area: data inferences</h5>
								<p>Sakuma and Hosoya<sup>2</sup> are working on generating machine learning and inference models to characterize potential links between gene expressions and phenotypic changes. The ability to correlate gene expressions is partly due to the Center's focus in drug discovery and our development of pyrrole-imidazole polyamides (PIPs), a class of programmable DNA minor-groove binders that have exceptional motif recognition specificity. The ability to synthesize PIPs with differential binding motifs allow us to selectively inhibit or even activate transcription, and these members then use information we obtain from microarrays and NGS experiments to make models that help us understand how the genomic landscape can be altered.</p><br/>

								<h3>Our Computing Resources</h3>
								<h4>rg20</h4>
								<p>
								We have built and operate <i>rg20</i>, a small-scale computing cluster; the namesake is merely a concatenation of <i>rinshogenome</i> ("Clinical Genomics") and the year I began as a staff scientist. <i>rg20</i> has a hair over 300 <i>x64</i> threads and 1.6 terabytes of RAM distributed in nodes of Dell, Fujitsu and HP machines linked together by a modified version of Son of Grid scheduler/queuing system. NVIDIA Corporation also provided us with a few ARM64 Jetson Nano SBC's via the Jetson Nano Developer Grant for instructional and research exercises in short-read sequencing analysis.

									Some of the Jetson Nano SBC's used in the lab.

								<p>Besides research projects outlined here, <i>rg20</i> also hosts some of the bioinformatics services that others at CCCRI use from time to time.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/rcl4.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								
								<h4>SHIROKANE</h4>
								<p>For tasks that require more resources or environments that <i>rg20</i> cannot sufficiently provide, we rely on the Human Genome Center's  <a href="https://gc.hgc.jp/en/sys-const/" target="_blank"><i>SHIROKANE</i> supercomputer system</a> at University of Tokyo Institute of Medical Sciences, especially in situations where GPUs are required.

								<h3>For Aspiring Degree Seekers</h3>
								<p>If you have an interest in pursuing research in computational genomics as well as cancer biology, Chiba Cancer Center and <a href="https://www.chiba-u.ac.jp/e/about/location/index.html" target="_blank">Chiba University</a> offers a Graduate Program in <a href="https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/gan/kenkyujo/education/index-en.html" target="_blank"> Molecular Biology and Oncology</a> through <a href="https://www.m.chiba-u.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank">Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine</a>; applicants will need to satisfy admission and graduation requirements and receive a Japanese equivalent<sup>&#8224;</sup> graduate degree in Master of Science (M.S.) or Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D); I can co-supervise graduate students through this capacity.</p>

									<p><i><sup>1</sup>Proof of who is who is left as an exercise.<br/><sup>2</sup>No first names will be provided here since you'd figure out who has what in an instant.</i><br/>									
									<sup>&#8224;</sup>I said <i>Japanese equivalent</i> because I am actually unsure whether your diploma will actually bear the verbatim titles of <i>Master of Science</i> (M.S.) or <i>Doctor of Phiolosophy</i> (Ph.D.) since Japanese institutions issue degrees in a slight different way than most western universities. While degrees such as  理学博士 (化学) (<i>lit.</i> "doctorate of science in chemistry"), 工学修士 (<i>lit.</i> "master of engineering"), or 医学博士 (<i>lit.</i> "doctorate of medicine") are decidedly different in title, in Japan they are all research-based degrees and do not reflect any sort of professional or terminal post-baccrelaureate training. This is different compared to say the U.S., where a M.Eng and M.S. in engineering can differ in that one is coursework-based and one research-based, or that a M.D.<sup>&#8224;&#8224;</sup> holder has undergone medical training and is qualified for medical licensure, in Japan all these degrees are research-based, awarded from different departments upon satisfying their graduation requirements. By "Japanese equivalent" I do not mean in any way that they're not real degrees, merely that <i>the transliteration of diploma titles will not always match word-for-word what is quoted in admission pamphlets in English</i>. This is more like the weirdness of how Harvard gives out AB degrees that are just funny names for BA, but not like how a BA in chemistry at Berkeley differs from a BS in chemistry.<br/><sup>&#8224;&#8224;</sup>Medical education in Japan is not post-graduate like the U.S. and <i>technically</i> medical school graduates get awarded a Bachelor in Medicine or Surgery; it is confusing since most physicians call themselves MD's anyway, and if they have gone to graduate school to become a physician scientist they often call themselves MD/PhDs like how most MSTP graduates are in the U.S. Again, this is an intricating consequence of how each country structures their education system.<br/><code>tl/dr</code> do <i>NOT</i> question your family physician if the diploma he/she hangs on the wall in the office <i>ONLY</i> says a bachelor of medicine! Or I guess you can suspect, it is entirely up to you. Standard legal disclaimer applies. Coupon has a face value less than a millionth of a U.S. cent, etc. lorem ipsum, Bob's your uncle and all that.</p>
